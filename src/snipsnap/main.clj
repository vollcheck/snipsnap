  "This is an example web application, using just a few basic Clojure
  libraries: Ring, Compojure, Component, Selmer, and next.jdbc.

  I recommend this as a good way to get started building web applications
  in Clojure so that you understand the basic moving parts in any web app.

  Ring is pretty much the fundamental building block of all web apps
  in Clojure. It provides an abstraction that maps HTTP requests to
  simple Clojure hash maps. Your handler processes those hash maps
  and produces another hash map containing :status and :body that
  Ring turns into an HTTP response.

  Compojure is the most widely used routing library. It lets you
  define mappings from URL patterns -- routes -- to handler functions.

  Selmer is a templating library that lets you write your web pages
  as HTML templates that follow the Django style of simple variable
  substitution, conditionals, and loops. Another popular approach
  for building web pages is Hiccup, which takes Clojure data structures
  and transforms them to HTML. If you need designers to deal with your
  HTML templates, Selmer is going to be a lot easier for them to work with.

  next.jdbc is the next generation JDBC library for Clojure, replacing
  clojure.java.jdbc. It provides a fast, idiomatic wrapper around the
  complexity that is Java's JDBC class hierarchy.

  This example uses a local SQLite database to store data."
